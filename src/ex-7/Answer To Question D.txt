With the sizeof operator, we can determine the size of the type that the array is build with (like the size of `int` or `Rectangle`).
Then we can get the total size in bytes by multiplying the size of the type with the array's length.
Because the size of char is byte, we can use the function `charArrCopy` by sending the same `int` or `Rectangle` array with the size of total bytes.
It would copy the bytes of the array without knowing the type itself. Thus, using the same function to copy int's, Rectangle's and more.
That's how most (if not all) C/C++ programmers copy objects, but they use the standart function `memcopy()`!
